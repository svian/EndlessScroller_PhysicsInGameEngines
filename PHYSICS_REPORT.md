Write a brief report explaining what physics you had to consider when making this. 

The main forms of physics that I used for this project was circle and wall collisions, circle Polygon collisions, and applying the force of gravity to the player. I ended up changing how I applied the gravity a couple of times. At first, I wanted to have gravity zones that would randomly spawn that if the player was inside that zone, then the gravity would be applied. Then I started having issues where the gravity force did not stop, even when the player was outside the dedicated zone, so I changed the game instead to have a changing gravity force that is always enacting on the player. And that worked well enough so I thought I would end up keeping that. However, near the end of coding this project the gravity was getting frustrating from the player perspective to fight against, and it was too controlling of how the game turned out, so I returned to my original idea of having gravity only applied when the player was within a certain space. I fixed the problems I originally had by not randomly generating the size of the gravity zone as well as only having one zone on the screen at a time. 

In the matter of collisions had some issues with the circle wall collisions that as of right now I still actually have not completely fixed. When the player collides with the wall obstacles head on, there's no issues, but if the player goes backwards and hits a wall the collision resolved function ends up kind of spitting the player backwards.
