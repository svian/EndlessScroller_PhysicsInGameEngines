This game is an endless obstacle course
The goal of the game is to last as long as you can and collect as many points possible
The game ends once you have no more lives left

# CONTROLS:
    -The player circle moves around the screen with the arrow keys

# OBSTACLES:
    -The game will spawn randomly placed walls on screen and obstruct your path
    -The game will spawn purple gravity zones the enforce a random amount of gravity

# SCREEN BOUNDARIES:
    -There are walls on the top and bottom of the screen to keep the player on path
    -Going off the left side of the screen will result in a large health loss
        -You will respawn at the starting position
    -Going off the right side of the screen has no consequence
    -At each multiple of 5 points, the top and bottom wall will increase in size and make the available path narrower
        -Walls do not shrink if points are lost to a Black Hole
# BITS:
    -Three types of 'Bits' are generated on-screen:
        -Blue bits are the points to collect. Each bit is 1 point
        -Red bits will cause 10 points damage to health on collision
        -Gold bits are worth 1 life
            -These spawn rarely and will move fast, so be sure to keep an eye out!
